#+title: Project Structure

Inside the directory ./Source each folder is a library or an executable. Each one of this folders contains a CMakeLists.txt file to config the build.

Each library should create an Alias at compile time like WModuleName::WModuleName that can be used to include and link in other module compilations. You can check some of the CMakeLists.txt files.

The Idea is that once the engine is compiled, you can use this libraries to create an executable.
